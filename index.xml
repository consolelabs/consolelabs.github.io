We cover a range of topics, from basics like &amp;lsquo;6 jars budgeting methodology&amp;rsquo; to more current subjects like &amp;lsquo;web3 liquidity techniques&amp;rsquo;.</description></item><item><title>CyberNeko NFT</title><link>https://log.console.so/experiments/neko/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/experiments/neko/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Emoji</title><link>https://log.console.so/experiments/emoji/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/experiments/emoji/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Kekcoin</title><link>https://log.console.so/experiments/kekk/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/experiments/kekk/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mochi</title><link>https://log.console.so/experiments/mochi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/experiments/mochi/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Pod Town</title><link>https://log.console.so/experiments/pod-town/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/experiments/pod-town/</guid><description/></item><item><title>WAGMI comics</title><link>https://log.console.so/experiments/wagmi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/experiments/wagmi/</guid><description/></item><item><title>How to work with emoji on Discord</title><link>https://log.console.so/playbook/render-emoji/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/playbook/render-emoji/</guid><description>by hnh
Emojis play a crucial role in Discord, enhancing the appearance and uniqueness of Discord content. We aim to utilize emojis to make our Bot better than others.
However, managing emojis is not as simple as it may seem. Along our journey, we&amp;rsquo;ve encountered some important considerations.
Product People first As engineers, we don&amp;rsquo;t make decisions about designs or changes to components. Initially, we hardcoded the emoji ID directly into our Discord bot&amp;rsquo;s source code.</description></item><item><title>About Us</title><link>https://log.console.so/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/about/</guid><description>Intro We‚Äôre Console Labs.

Background @Console Labs, our primary goal is to rapidly introduce new features and gather user feedback as quickly as possible. We understand that this approach isn&amp;rsquo;t flawless and can lead to regression bugs. However, at this stage of our product development, we are content with this strategy.
The challenge arises when we aim to develop something new within a short timeframe, typically one week or even just two days.</description></item><item><title>Data layer</title><link>https://log.console.so/playbook/data-layer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/playbook/data-layer/</guid><description>by hnh
This data layer serves as the central source of information for various features such as tickers, price alerts, and token details. These features rely on the data within this layer to provide accurate and up-to-date information to users. In essence, it&amp;rsquo;s like the beating heart of the mochi ecosystem, ensuring that all the essential data is readily available for users to access and use.
Raw Data The raw data that powers our system originates from blockchain transaction data, which we can retrieve from various RPC sources.</description></item><item><title>Leverage Mochi balances</title><link>https://log.console.so/playbook/integrate-mochi-balances/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/playbook/integrate-mochi-balances/</guid><description>by hnh, minh_cloud</description></item><item><title>Log</title><link>https://log.console.so/blog/log/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/blog/log/</guid><description>A list of changes and updates to our experiments.

Problems &amp;amp; Background Have you ever been frustrated by reading an app&amp;rsquo;s changelog that&amp;rsquo;s full of unhelpful information? It&amp;rsquo;s like they don&amp;rsquo;t care about their product or their users. You might have seen changelogs like this:

What Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied.
One of the key benefits of integrating regularly is that you can detect errors quickly and locate them more easily.</description></item><item><title>Format a Neko profile</title><link>https://log.console.so/playbook/format-profile-number/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/playbook/format-profile-number/</guid><description>by hnh,
Intro When it comes to UI rendering, there&amp;rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all &amp;ldquo;correct way.&amp;rdquo; This is especially true for us because we&amp;rsquo;re building across various platforms and ecosystems, each with its unique user behavior. Consequently, there&amp;rsquo;s no universal UI rendering approach that suits every situation.
In today&amp;rsquo;s article, we&amp;rsquo;ll delve into our first component: the &amp;ldquo;Neko Profile.&amp;rdquo;

In the rapidly evolving blockchain industry, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to keep up with the pace of change. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick overview of how we seamlessly integrate new chains into the Mochi system, with the caveat that this method is specific to EVM-based blockchains:

Money&amp;rsquo;s a universal symbol representing the value of our hard work. While we‚Äôre all working to create value, those in the finance sector are trading these values, often reaping the benefits.
With the advancement of technology, accessing financial data has become straightforward, especially with the development of on-chain technologies. The financial world is continuously evolving with new concepts and inventions, but its core principles remain the same.</description></item><item><title>Shared UI library in multiple platforms</title><link>https://log.console.so/playbook/shared-ui-lib/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/playbook/shared-ui-lib/</guid><description>by hnh
Background Earlier this year, we introduced a new version of Telegram for Mochi, but it came with some new challenges.
Up until now, we&amp;rsquo;ve been using a single backend system to support all of our services. This approach was taken to ensure a smooth experience for both users and engineers across different platforms. However, a problem arose when it came to the user interface. We found ourselves dealing with two different sets of rules (Discord &amp;amp; Telegram) for how the interface should look and behave.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://log.console.so/members/anna/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/members/anna/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://log.console.so/members/hnh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/members/hnh/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://log.console.so/members/minh_cloud/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/members/minh_cloud/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://log.console.so/members/neko-san/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/members/neko-san/</guid><description>Notes</description></item><item><title/><link>https://log.console.so/members/vincent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/members/vincent/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
