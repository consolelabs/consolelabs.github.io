We understand that this approach isn&amp;rsquo;t flawless and can lead to regression bugs. However, at this stage of our product development, we are content with this strategy.
The challenge arises when we aim to develop something new within a short timeframe, typically one week or even just two days. This typically involves creating a small set of new features, starting from gathering requirements, designing the features, and then implementing them on both the backend and frontend.</description></item><item><title>Data layer</title><link>https://log.console.so/playbook/data-layer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/playbook/data-layer/</guid><description>This data layer serves as the central source of information for various features such as tickers, price alerts, and token details. These features rely on the data within this layer to provide accurate and up-to-date information to users. In essence, it&amp;rsquo;s like the beating heart of the mochi ecosystem, ensuring that all the essential data is readily available for users to access and use.
Raw Data The raw data that powers our system originates from blockchain transaction data, which we can retrieve from various RPC sources.</description></item><item><title>Leverage Mochi balances</title><link>https://log.console.so/playbook/integrate-mochi-balances/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@console.so (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://log.console.so/playbook/integrate-mochi-balances/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
