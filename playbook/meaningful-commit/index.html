It&rsquo;s like they don&rsquo;t care about their product or their users. You might have seen changelogs like this:</p><blockquote><p>2.11.4</p><ul><li>Some bugs fixed</li></ul><p>or</p><ul><li>Fix bugs and improve UI/UX</li></ul></blockquote><p>These changelogs are confusing and don&rsquo;t provide any meaningful insights for users. Changelogs are meant for people, not machines. They serve as a way for us to communicate with our users. Whether you&rsquo;re working on a big or small software project, it&rsquo;s essential to create a useful changelog.</p><p>In the early stages, our commit messages were similar, not designed for humans, product teams, or even fellow engineers. They looked something like this:</p><blockquote><p>üêû Bugs</p><ul><li>Correct releaserc cfg (4337ccb)</li><li>Disable webpage preview in tip message (1fe0fae)</li><li>Remove extra @ in tip message (e6ac302)</li><li>Sentry check ticker command (#64) (f81c9ca)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Initially, we didn&rsquo;t see anything wrong with these messages; in fact, we considered them good. However, as time passed, we realized that we were missing essential context, such as which features, platforms, or affected areas these commits related to.</p><p>So, we decided to change the way we write commit messages and put in a bit more effort to enhance our notification platform. Now, with each release, we have clear and informative messages like this:</p><p><img src=/playbook/../images/playbook/changelog.png></p><h2 id=how><a href=#how>How <a href=#how>¬∂</a></a></h2><p>We&rsquo;ve adopted a specific syntax when creating a new commit:</p><p><code>level(scope): message</code></p><ul><li><strong>level</strong>: This indicates the nature of the change, such as a refactor, improvement, chore, fix, or feature.</li><li><strong>scope</strong>: This specifies which feature or area is affected by the changes.</li><li><strong>message</strong>: This is where we explain to users what they need to know about the update.</li></ul><h3 id=checklist><a href=#checklist>Checklist <a href=#checklist>¬∂</a></a></h3><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Focus on what matters most to users: new features, bug fixes, and improvements in terms of UI/speed.</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Write messages with users in mind, not just for fellow engineers.</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Always consolidate your PRs into a single commit to maintain a clean and coherent commit history.</li></ul></article></body></html>
